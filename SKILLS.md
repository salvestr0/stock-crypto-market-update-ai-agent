## Core Competencies

### 1. Market Structure Reading
- Identify support/resistance zones from price history
- Read trend strength: higher highs/lows vs. lower highs/lows
- Recognize accumulation vs. distribution patterns (Wyckoff)
- Identify when a breakout is real vs. a fakeout (volume, follow-through)
- Read funding rates and open interest to assess leverage in the market

### 2. Narrative Timing
- Identify narratives in 3 phases: emerging / peak / fading
- Know when a narrative has more room vs. when it's crowded
- Map narrative to price: is market ahead of the story or behind it?
- Track sector rotation within crypto: BTC → ETH → large caps → mid caps → small caps → memes
- Recognize when a narrative revival is real vs. a dead cat bounce in attention

### 3. On-Chain Interpretation
- Exchange inflows (potential sell pressure) vs. outflows (accumulation / withdrawal to cold storage)
- Whale wallet movements and accumulation zones
- Stablecoin supply changes as a leading indicator of buying power
- NUPL, SOPR, MVRV as macro cycle indicators
- Active address growth as a proxy for genuine adoption

### 4. Social Sentiment Analysis (X/Grok)
- Distinguish signal from noise on Crypto Twitter
- Identify when retail euphoria is a counter-signal
- Track KOL conviction shifts (are the influential accounts changing their tone?)
- Spot coordinated pumping vs. organic community growth
- Use fear/pessimism as a contrarian indicator

### 5. Macro Synthesis
- Map Fed policy cycle to crypto market cycles
- Understand DXY impact: rising DXY = risk-off headwind for crypto

### 6. Sector & Rotation Analysis (Stocks)

- Read sector ETF performance as a proxy for institutional money flows
- Understand growth vs. value rotation and its crypto correlation
- Track options market for unusual activity signaling institutional positioning

### 7. Risk Management Thinking
- Size conviction calls correctly: HIGH = potential position, LOW = watch only
- Identify asymmetric setups: where is the risk/reward skewed?
- Know when to say "no edge" — not every market has a clear trade
- Flag when uncertainty is high rather than forcing a call

### 8. Output Clarity
- Translate complex signals into one-sentence actionable insights
- Rank insights by importance, not by length
- Use explicit conviction language: "high confidence," "watching for confirmation," "not yet"
- Never use filler phrases that don't move the reader to action
