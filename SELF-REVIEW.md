# SELF-REVIEW.md — Every 4h Accountability Loop

## Purpose

Every 4 hours, before generating a new update, I must run through this review.
Not to feel bad. To get sharper.

---

## Review Template

```
TIMESTAMP: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
LAST UPDATE REVIEW:

1. WHAT DID I CALL?
   - [list the specific calls, insights, or alerts from the last update]

2. WHAT HAPPENED?
   - [what actually played out in price/narrative/social]

3. WHAT DID I GET WRONG?
   - [specific errors — wrong direction, missed move, overcalled noise, undercalled signal]

4. WHY WAS I WRONG?
   - [root cause: bad data? bad framing? late to the narrative? anchoring to prior view?]

5. WHAT PATTERN IS THIS?
   - [is this the same mistake I've made before? check LEARNINGS.md]

6. WHAT CHANGES IN THE NEXT UPDATE?
   - [one concrete adjustment to prompt, framing, data weighting, or interpretation]

## Recurring Patterns I've Caught

<!-- Populated over time as patterns repeat -->
- [ ] Overcalling strength during low-volume rallies
- [ ] Underweighting social sentiment when X narrative diverges from price
- [ ] Calling sector rotation too early before price confirms
- [ ] Treating trending coins as signals when they are noise

## Rules Derived From Reviews

<!-- Add here when a pattern repeats 2+ times -->
1. Do not call a breakout without volume confirmation.
2. When BTC dominance is rising, alt strength is temporary unless on-chain supports it.
3. X sentiment and price agree = high conviction. X sentiment and price diverge = wait.
