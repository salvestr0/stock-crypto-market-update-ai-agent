## Current Market Regime

```
Risk Appetite:     RISK-OFF — Broad market jitters, DXY rising.
BTC Trend:         DOWNTREND
BTC Dominance:     FALLING → Alts might gain relative strength if BTC stabilizes.
Alt Season:        NONE
Macro Backdrop:    Strengthening DXY and rising VIX suppress risk appetite.
VIX Level:         20.09 + spiking
DXY Trend:         RISING → Headwind for risk assets.
```

## Active Hypotheses

```
H1: The 'Game Studio' crypto category will continue its strong upward momentum as early speculative interest intensifies. — Confidence: MEDIUM — Status: FORMING
H2: Defensive stock sectors (Energy, Financials, Consumer Staples, Utilities) will outperform growth sectors (Technology, Nasdaq 100) in the near term. — Confidence: HIGH — Status: ACTIVE
H3: Despite short-term spot weakness, BTC's price will experience increased volatility as conflicting futures market signals (positive funding, negative basis) resolve. — Confidence: MEDIUM — Status: FORMING
```

## Watchlist — High Priority

| Asset / Sector | Why I'm Watching | Trigger to Act |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| BTC | Struggling to maintain momentum after failing to approach ATHs. | Holds key support levels around $65,000. |
| SOL | Deeper pullback after a strong week, indicating profit-taking. | Reversal from current profit-taking levels or stabilization above $80. |
| HYPE | Underperformed BTC and SOL over the past week, showing weak relative strength. | Breakout above $29.00 or improved relative strength against major alts. |
| Game Studio | Massive 24h gains indicating strong speculative inflow as an early opportunity. | Continued high volume and positive price action in top coins like Power Protocol. |

## Open Questions

1. How will the conflicting signals in BTC's derivatives market (positive funding, negative basis) resolve, and what will be its impact on spot price?
2. Will the rotation from growth to defensive sectors in traditional equities continue, and how long will it impact overall market sentiment?
3. What will be the exact impact of today's Core PPI m/m and PPI m/m data on market sentiment and Fed policy expectations?

## What I Was Wrong About Last Run

`No prior run to review.`

## What I Am Most Confident About Right Now

`The market is showing a clear shift from growth to value/defensive sectors amidst rising volatility, indicated by the VIX surge and tech sell-off coupled with strength in Energy and Financials.`
