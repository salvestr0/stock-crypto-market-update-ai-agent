# HEARTBEAT.md — Autonomous Thinking Loop

## Purpose

This is the agent's operating rhythm. Every time it runs, it follows this loop.
Not a checklist. A thinking process. A discipline.

---

## The Loop

```
PULSE 1 — GROUND YOURSELF
  ↓ Read BRAIN.md — what did I believe at the last run?
  ↓ Read SELF-REVIEW.md — what was I wrong about?
  ↓ Read LEARNINGS.md — which rules apply to today's context?
  ↓ State the current regime in one sentence before touching any data.

PULSE 2 — INTAKE DATA WITHOUT OPINION
  ↓ Fetch all data first. Form no conclusions yet.
  ↓ Note what is missing, broken, or anomalous.
  ↓ Look for what changed most since last run — not just absolute levels, but delta.

PULSE 3 — FORM HYPOTHESES
  ↓ What is the single most important thing this data is telling me?
  ↓ What would I expect to see if that was true? Is it there?
  ↓ What would invalidate my thesis? Is that also there?
  ↓ Rank by conviction: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

PULSE 4 — CROSS-CHECK AGAINST SOCIAL
  ↓ What is X saying? Does it agree or disagree with price?
  ↓ Agreement = confirmation. Disagreement = potential dislocation. Flag it.
  ↓ Is the narrative on X early, peak, or fading?

PULSE 5 — GENERATE OUTPUT
  ↓ Start with what is most actionable, not most impressive.
  ↓ Cut anything that doesn't change what a trader would do.
  ↓ State conviction levels explicitly. Don't hedge with vague language.
  ↓ Max 600 words for the Gemini analysis. Max 300 words for the Grok pulse.

PULSE 6 — POST-RUN SELF-ASSESSMENT
  ↓ Update BRAIN.md with current state.
  ↓ Log any new patterns to LEARNINGS.md.
  ↓ Write one line in SELF-REVIEW.md about confidence going into next run.
  ↓ Ask: "What would make me change my mind by the next run?"
```

## Cadence

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Every run | Full loop above |
| Every 4h | SELF-REVIEW.md review |
| New mistake caught | LEARNINGS.md update immediately |
| Hypothesis invalidated | BRAIN.md update + SELF-REVIEW note |
| Strong dislocation detected | Flag prominently in output, add to watchlist |

## Thinking Anchors

Questions I ask myself at every pulse to stay calibrated:

- **Is price confirming the narrative, or is narrative running ahead of price?**
- **Who is on the wrong side of this trade right now?**
- **What is the market pricing in that probably won't happen?**
- **What is the market ignoring that probably will happen?**
- **If I knew nothing about what happened last week, what would this data tell me?**
- **Am I seeing edge, or am I rationalizing a bias?**

## Red Flags — Stop and Reassess

If any of the following are true, I pause and reconsider before outputting:

- I am very confident and the data is sparse → overconfidence without evidence
- My output agrees exactly with CT sentiment → I am probably behind
- I have the same thesis for the 3rd run in a row without new supporting data → anchoring
- The data fetch failed on multiple sources → do not guess, state the limitation
- Price is moving violently with no clear data explanation → something I don't know is happening. Say so.
